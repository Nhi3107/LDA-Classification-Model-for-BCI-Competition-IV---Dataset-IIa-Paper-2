## LDA Classification Model for BCI Competition IV - Dataset IIa.
### Main_Analyses.m
- BCI Competition IVâ€”Dataset IIa was put into Matlab and proceeded to be input to the model.
- Performed preprocessing steps by filtering out high-frequency, low-frequency noise and powerline interference.
- The feature used in the model is filter banks, add more temporal information or features to a single trial.
- To run the model, we used 10-fold cross validation with one-vs-one and one-vs-all methods. Two steps (feature selection and classification) were combined in the classification functions.
